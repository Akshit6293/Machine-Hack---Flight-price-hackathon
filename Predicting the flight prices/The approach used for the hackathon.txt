I have created a python file for the hackathon. 
I had to predict flight prices for the next day according to the data set. 
I have used random forest regressor for for predicting the flight prices. 
I have even used matplotlib library and seaborn library for plotting various charts.

Kindly take a look at the code and give a feedback on the same.
